# TransitApp

I used Cocoapods as a the third party dependency manager, if you're not familiar with Cocoapods, here's a link to set it up (it's super simple) :

Once installed:

0. Close the Xcode project if opened. 
1. Open a terminal window, and $ cd into the project directory.
2. Run pod with command $ pod install (it might take a few minutes).
3. Now, go to the project directory and open TransitApp.xcworckspace (not the .xcodeproj) and build.
