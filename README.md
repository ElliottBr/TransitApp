# TransitApp

I used Cocoapods as a the third party dependency manager, if you're not familiar with Cocoapods, here's a link to set it up (it's super simple) :

https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html

Once installed:

0. Close the Xcode project if opened. 
1. Open a terminal window, and $ cd into the project directory.
2. Run pod with command $ pod install (it might take a few minutes).
3. Now, go to the project directory and open TransitApp.xcworckspace (not the .xcodeproj) and build.


Comments on Ally and code challenge,

I used the json file as "persistent" data; nevertheless, in a real scenario, persistent storage would be necessary. I didn't concentrate to much on the way the information for a specific itinerary is presented, with more time, I would have. 

I've followed the UI design of the Ally application; Before making my decision though, I've compared it to many other Transit applications out there and it is by far one my favorite. I like the simplicity of the UI and the absence of any confusing elements. Ally is great because it is straightforward and makes no mistake bringing me where I need.

For further developments, it might be interesting to add a comparing UI to the view that presents all the alternative routes (after instantiating the search). It could be useful to bring out with one tap, which route is cheaper, which is better for the environment (less carbon emission), or perhaps the one that has the most likes. This last point brings me to the next:

Another interesting aspect to think about is the social dimension. Mobility is at the heart of cities, and an activity we all share. I  think there would be some great opportunities in this regard when considering that Ally is already a community of modern commuters.  Some applications already do share locations among friends, but I don't think they achieve true momentum because you wouldn't just use an application to share your geolocation, I wouldn't; nevertheless, you might do it if the application hade some real benefits and embeded this new behavior in a modern way of perceiving urban mobility, hence Ally.

I enjoyed very much working on this project, and I hope it will spark an interesting conversation between us.
