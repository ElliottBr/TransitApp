1. Open a terminal window, and $ cd into your project directory.
2. Create a Podfile. This can be done by running $ pod init.
3. run pod with command $ pod install.
4. Now, go to the project directory and open App.xcworckspace and build


Comments on Ally and code challenge,

I used the json file as "persistent" data; nevertheless, in a real scenario, persistent storage would be necessary.

I've followed the UI design of the Ally application; Before making my decision though, I've compared it to many other Transit Applications out there and it is by far one my favorite. I like the simplicity of the UI and the absence of any confusing elements. The Application is great because it is straightforward and makes no mistake bringing me where I need.

I think it might be interesting to add a comparing UI when all the alternative routes are presented in a table. It could be useful to bring out which route is cheaper, which is better for the environment, the one prefered by my friends. This last brings me to the next:

Another interesting aspect to think about is the social dimension. Mobility is at the heart of cities, and an activity we all share. I  think there would be some great opportunities in this regard when considering that Ally is already a communitee of modern commuters.  Some Applications already do share locations among friends, but I don't think they achieve true momentum because you wouldn't just use an application to share your geolocation, I wouldn't; nevertheless, you might do it if the application hade some real benefits and embeded this new behavior in a modern way of perceiving urban mobility, hence Ally.

I enjoyed very much working on this project, and I hope it will spark an interesting conversation between us.
